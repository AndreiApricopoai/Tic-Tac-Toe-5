# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic-tac-toe game made with C and C++ for a school project.
The player has to connect 5 dots instead of 3 (the base game).

Options:
  - You can play against a friend on the same machine.
  - You can also play against a bot on 2 levels of difficulty (EASY and HARD).
  - A side bar containing options for changing the grid, reset the game, go to the previous move and so on.
 
 ENJOY!
